For this one we'll just simulate the network stuff.
Cryptopals.RSA.Attacks implements 'umrOracle', the simulated
client/server interaction, as well as 'umrperturb', a function for
'perturbing' collected ciphertexts, and 'umrrecover', a function for
recovering plaintexts from the oracle's response.

The more interesting part of this challenge is understanding the modular
arithmetic going on. We have, for plaintext p and ciphertext c:

    c = p ^ e mod n
    p = c ^ d mod n

Now, encrypt a random 's' under the same pubkey. We have:

    t = s ^ e mod n
    s = t ^ d mod n

and now note that:

    (c t) mod n = (m ^ e mod n) (s ^ e mod n)
                = (m s) ^ e mod n

since exponentiation distributes over multiplication. If we have an
arbitrary decryption oracle, then we can get:

    p' = (c t) ^ d mod n
       = ((c ^ d mod n) (t ^ d mod n)) mod n
       = (p s) mod n

such that, for q the multiplicative inverse of s = t ^ d modulo n:

    p = p' q mod n.

So, let's generate a keypair and kick off the oracle. There are a lot of
really long lines here so I'll abbreviate the logs accordingly:

    > per <- keygen 1024
    > evalStateT (runEffect (umrOracle per)) mempty

It prints out the generated public key for convenience:

    (cryptopals) umr-oracle: running with public key
    Pub 3 22513321964659585055936315428684912055916908912276341574563352485..
    (cryptopals) umr-oracle: awaiting hex-encoded input

In another GHCi session we can mimic a user inputting their deepest, darkest
secrets:

    > let msg = "my secret crush is so-and-so"
    > let pub = <above logged pubkey>
    > let cip = encrypt pub msg

Hex-encoding the ciphertext and submitting it, the oracle spits out the
hex-encoded plaintext:

    (cryptopals) umr-oracle: decrypted text
    6d792073656372657420637275736820697320736f2d616e642d736f

and submitting it again (say, now, we're Mallory) yields nothing:

    (cryptopals) umr-oracle: rejecting request
    (cryptopals) umr-oracle: awaiting hex-encoded input

So now we go and adjust the ciphertext via 'umrperturb', which returns
the randomly generated number and the perturbed ciphertext (both of
which are way too long to print here):

    > gen <- MWC.createSystemRandom
    > (s, c') <- umrperturb pub cip gen

We hex-encode c' and submit it to the oracle again, this time receiving
a different hex-encoded plaintext back. This one is very long, since,
via our math above, it's a product of big integers:

    (cryptopals) umr-server: decrypted text
    c49c9dac3b7b4a86bf29eebafb3650469a5b91bf23c5339043ff9b72895953a21ff157f8..

Calling the hex-decoded bytestring p', we can feed it into 'umrrecover'
to crack the juicy secret:

    > umrrecover pub s p'
    "my secret crush is so-and-so"

Shame, shame.
