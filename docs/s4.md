### Set 4

#### 4.25

If we can control the offset and plaintext input, then we can ask
the oracle to encrypt a plaintext with the same length of the
ciphertext at offset 0. *Et voil√†*, there's our keystream, which we
can just xor with the original ciphertext in order to decrypt it.
Cryptopals.Stream.Attacks.rawrCtrAttack implements such an "attack":

    rawrCtrAttack :: IO BS.ByteString
    rawrCtrAttack = do
      cip <- rawrCtrOracle (maxBound :: Int) mempty
      let l = BS.length cip
          p = BS.replicate l 65

      new <- rawrCtrOracle 0 p
      let ks = new `CU.fixedXor` p

      pure $ ks `CU.fixedXor` cip

Which gives the expected plaintext:

    > fmap (BS.take 33) rawrCtrAttack
    "I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell"
