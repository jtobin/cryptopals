The basic Diffie-Hellman algorithm for key exchange between Alice and
Bob goes as follows. Alice and Bob agree on a finite cyclic group of
some particular order to use. They each randomly and independently pick
some number of times to perform the group operation (which must be
greater than zero, and less than the order of the group) and perform the
group operation on the generator that number of times, publishing their
results. For generator g, Alice's number x, and Bob's number y: Alice
publishes g ^ x, and Bob publishes g ^ y.

Each then performs his or her own secret number of additional group
operations on the other's public result, establishing the key g ^ xy.
Since the discrete logarithm problem is hard, an eavesdropper can't (for
an appropriate group) determine how many times either has performed the
individual group operations, even given g; he can only naïvely calculate
g ^ (x + y).

For the initial illustration here we're using a decidedly insecure
group, i.e. the multiplicative group of 16-bit words modulo 37:

    > gen <- MWC.create
    > let p = 37
    > let g = 5
    > a <- fmap (`mod` p) (MWC.uniformR (1, p - 1) gen) :: IO Word16
    > b <- fmap (`mod` p) (MWC.uniformR (1, p - 1) gen) :: IO Word16
    > let bigA = g ^ a `mod` p
    > let bigB = g ^ b `mod` p
    > let s = bigB ^ a `mod` p
    > let t = bigA ^ b `mod` p
    > s == t
    True
    > let k = S.sha1 . BP.runPut $ BP.putWord16be s
    > k
    ace6f761db204030c1a65c0930bd01fd55ecc429

For the big guns, we can pull out GHC's Natural type, for which
mwc-random (our preferred random library) can generate something in a
range. First a modular exponentiation routine:

    -- modified from https://gist.github.com/trevordixon/6788535
    modexp :: Natural -> Natural -> Natural -> Natural
    modexp b e m
      | e == 0    = 1
      | otherwise =
          let t = if B.testBit e 0 then b `mod` m else 1
          in  t * modexp ((b * b) `mod` m) (B.shiftR e 1) m `mod` m

and given that (and appropriate p, g), the key exchange:

    > gen <- MWC.create
    > a <- fmap (`mod` p) (MWC.uniformRM (1, p - 1) gen)
    > b <- fmap (`mod` p) (MWC.uniformRM (1, p - 1) gen)
    > let bigA = modexp g a p
    > let bigB = modexp g b p
    > let s = modexp bigB a p
    > let t = modexp bigA b p
    > s == t
    True

That's all well and good, but let's have a bit of fun.

Cryptopals.DH implements the Diffie-Hellman protocol over TCP. Two
functions, 'bob' and 'alice', will initiate a TCP server and client,
respectively. Each takes as argument a port to bind to and a protocol to
follow, with Alice also taking an argument specifying the initial action
she'll take. The two will then perform the specified protocol.

The 'dh' protocol specifies Diffie-Hellman, and for the lulz Alice and
Bob will exchange a message, AES128-encrypted with the shared key, à la
the initial illustration in the next challenge.

Opening two instances of GHCi, we can run e.g.:

    > bob "3000" dh

in one, and:

    > alice "3000" dh

in the other and watch the logs for fun. Here I'll interleave the
relevant parts of the logs for readability:

#### 5.34

If B = p in s = B ^ a mod p, then s = p ^ a mod p, which is zero for any
'a' in the group. Our shared key is thus going to be the first 16 bytes
of the SHA1 hash of an appropriately-serialized 0x00.

Cryptopals.DH includes a 'mallory' agent that requires a port to listen
on, a port to bind to, and a protocol to follow. By using the 'dhmitm'
protocol, we get our man-in-the-middle attack on Alice and Bob's DH key
exchange.

You can get this going by opening three GHCi's, then launching e.g.:

    > bob "3000" dh

in one, then:

    > mallory "3001" "3000" dhmitm

in another, and finally:

    > alice "3001" dh sendParams

in the third. Again, I'm interleaving the logs for readability:

#### 5.35

Cryptopals.DH.dhng implements the negotiated-groups DH protocol, so that
can be run by firing off e.g.:

    > bob "3000" dhng

in one GHCi session, and:

    > alice "3000" dhng sendGroup

in the other. In the meantime, we can figure out the outcomes of using
the different malicious group parameters analytically.

For g = 1, the MITM attack starts as follows:

    alice sends      p, g
    bob gets         p, 1

If Bob receives g = 1, then Mallory knows his public key will equal 1 ^
b mod p = 1, as will the shared key from Alice's perspective (since 1 ^
a mod p = 1). Mallory thus needs to forward a 1 as Alice's public key in
order for Bob to agree on the shared key.

For g = p, Bob computes B = p ^ b mod p = 0, so Mallory can forward p as
Alice's public key in order for them to agree on the shared key.

Finally, the case of g = p - 1. Note that for any p > 1 and any even b, we
have (for appropriate coefficients a, c, etc.):

    (p - 1) ^ b mod p
      = (p^b + .. + ap^2 + cp + 1) mod p
      = (p^b mod p + .. + ap^2 mod p + cp mod p + 1 mod p) mod p
      = (0 + .. + 0 + 1 mod p) mod p
      = 1

whereas for any odd b, we have:

    (p - 1) ^ b mod p
      = (p^b - .. - cp^2 + dp - 1) mod p
      = (p^b mod p - .. - ap^2 mod p + cp mod p - 1 mod p) mod p
      = (0 + .. + 0 - 1 mod p) mod p
      = p - 1.

So Bob's public key will be either 1 or p - 1 depending on whether his
secret key is even or odd. Alice will thus compute:

    s = B ^ a mod p
      = 1               } b even or a even  (p = 3/4)
        p - 1           } b odd and a odd.  (p = 1/4).

If Mallory then forwards A = g = p - 1 to Bob, we have:

    t = A ^ b mod p
      = 1               } b even  (p = 1/2)
      = p - 1           } b odd   (p = 1/2).

This all yields the following table:

                            a
                even              odd
        even   s = 1, t = 1      s = 1, t = 1
    b
        odd    s = 1, t = p - 1  s = p - 1, t = p - 1

such that Alice and Bob will agree on the shared key with probability
3/4. Mallory also has to choose which shared key value he uses; if he
uses 1, then the attack succeeds with probability 1/2, and if he uses
p - 1, then it succeeds with probability 1/4.

Here are the interleaved logs of a successful attack. Start mallory with
e.g. the `dhngmitm 1`, `dhngmitm p`, or `dhngmitm (p - 1)` protocol:

SRP (Secure Remote Password) is an authentication protocol for which
a client authenticates with a server via a zero-knowledge proof.
Cryptopals.SRP implements it much in the same way that Cryptopals.DH
implements Diffie-Hellman; here one can perform the protocol via the
'server' and 'client' functions analogously.

Some interleaved logs for 'server "3000" srp' and 'client "3000" srp
auth':

    (cryptopals) server: listening..
    (cryptopals) client: session established
    (cryptopals) client: sending authentication request
    (cryptopals) server: received authentication request for l33th4x0r@hotmail.com
    (cryptopals) server: acking authentication request for l33th4x0r@hotmail.com
    (cryptopals) client: received authentication request ack

    (cryptopals) server: OK

#### 5.37

If the client forwards A = 0 (or anything congruent modulo N to 0) as
its public key, then the server will compute S = 0 as its shared secret.
Whoops! The client can then just pass along the appropriate MAC to
authenticate.

Example, with the client using the 'srpzero' protocol and 'authZero'
initial action:

    -- GHCi instance one
    > server "3000" srp
    -- GHCi instance two
    > client "3000" srpZero authZero
    (cryptopals) server: listening..
    (cryptopals) client: session established
    (cryptopals) client: sending authentication request with a zero key
    (cryptopals) server: received authentication request for l33th4x0r@hotmail.com
    (cryptopals) server: acking authentication request for l33th4x0r@hotmail.com
    (cryptopals) client: received authentication request ack
    (cryptopals) client: sending MAC 5xO9hEUJOTX5EIU+DmYV0QOs1L1oVp3fphREooN/8L4=
    (cryptopals) server: received MAC 5xO9hEUJOTX5EIU+DmYV0QOs1L1oVp3fphREooN/8L4=
    (cryptopals) server: OK

#### 5.38

The simplified protocol can be run with the 'server' and 'client'
functions in Cryptopals.SRP.Simple.

For the MITM attack, the idea is that, posing as the server, Mallory has
control over the parameters 'salt', 'b', 'B', and 'u', but doesn't know
anything to do with 'x', and so has to guess at that.

If Mallory supplies salt = mempty, B = g mod n, and u = 1, then the
client will compute:

    S = g ^ (a + x) mod n

and forward him MAC = HMAC-SHA256(SHA256(S), mempty). Duly supplied with
the client's public key ('A') and MAC, and using a trivial b = 1 as a
secret key, Mallory can guess x = SHA256(password) to compute:

    S' = (A v) mod n
       = (A g ^ x) mod n

and then check if HMAC-SHA256(SHA256(S'), mempty) = MAC. If it verifies,
then he knows the password.

To not make this too annoying, I'll draw the password to be cracked from
/usr/share/dict/words. Once Mallory provides the public key and MAC
from the client, we'll generate our dictionary and check if the MAC is
present in the keyspace using a compiled, optimized binary.

Here's a run of the MITM protocol (`mallory "3000" mitm` and `client
"3000" srpsimple auth`):

    (cryptopals) mallory: LiSteNiNG..

Now taking those parameters to the `offline-dictionary-attack` binary we get
the result pretty quickly:

    $ PK="4992116105881074929461308645820763003777270799868975573291"

A note on primegen for RSA: I didn't bother with it, as recommended, but
looked at how it should be done. It seems straightforward; one generates
a sufficiently large random number, then tests that it isn't divisible
by the first serveral hundred primes, then performs a probabilistic
primality test sufficiently many times that the error probability is
very small. A reference suggested that the error probability should be
less than 1 / 2^128.

I used cryptonite's Crypto.Number.Prime module, which implements the
above procedure.

In any case, RSA: one finds two k-bit primes, 'p' and 'q', and uses
their product to construct a public modulus n = pq and value `t = (p -
1) (q - 1)`. The public key is (n, e) for 'e' a number relatively prime
to 't', and the private key is (n, d), for d such that `ed = 1 mod t`
(i.e., 'd' is congruent mod 't' to the inverse of 'e'). "Relatively
prime" or "coprime" means, for two numbers 'a' and 'b', that they have a
greatest common denominator of 1.

Encryption and decryption are then just modular exponentiation
operations using the keys. To go from Natural to ByteString and back,
I used some old functions -- roll and unroll -- that I wrote for
[urbit-hob](http://git.jtobin.io/urbit-hob) a few years back (though
actually I think I cribbed them from the Data.Binary internals):

    data Key = Key Natural Natural
      deriving (Eq, Show)

    data Keypair = Keypair {
        sec :: Key
      , pub :: Key
      } deriving (Eq, Show)

    keygen :: Int -> IO Keypair
    keygen siz = loop where
      loop = do
        p <- fromIntegral <$> P.generatePrime siz
        q <- fromIntegral <$> P.generatePrime siz
        let n   = p * q
            et  = pred p * pred q
            e   = 3
            md  = modinv e et
        case md of
          Nothing -> loop
          Just d  -> pure $ Keypair (Key d n) (Key e n)

    encrypt :: Key -> BS.ByteString -> BS.ByteString
    encrypt (Key e n) m = unroll (DH.modexp (roll m) e n)

    decrypt :: Key -> BS.ByteString -> BS.ByteString
    decrypt = encrypt

Works fine:

    > Keypair sec pub <- keygen 1024
    > let cip = encrypt pub "secret!"
    > TIO.putStrLn $ T.take 32 $ B64.encodeBase64 cip
    zZFjaw7BR6rP0EaNsTFRnCInwsghANrE
    > let msg = decrypt sec cip
    > msg
    "secret!"

The Cryptopals.RSA module exports the keygen, encrypt, and decrypt
functions, as well as modinv and roll & unroll.

The problem behind the Chinese Remainder Theorem, as formulated by one
孫子 (not *that* 孫子) and passed on to me via Wikipedia, is:

> There are certain things whose number is unknown. If we count them by
> threes, we have two left over; by fives, we have three left over; and
> by sevens, two are left over. How many things are there?

I.e. what is x, if x is congruent to 2 mod 3, 3 mod 5, and 2 mod 7?

In Sunzi's case the answer is congruent to 23 mod 105, and the Chinese
Remainder Theorem states that such a solution always exists given
certain conditions (notably that the moduli are pairwise coprime).

In our case, for plaintext 'm' and ciphertexts c0, c1, and c2, we have
that m ^ 3 is congruent to c0 mod n0, c1 mod n1, and c2 mod n2. The
Chinese Remainder Theorem asserts that there exists some 'c' that is
congruent to m ^ 3 modulo `n0 * n1 * n2`. The trick here (this is known
as Håstad's attack, apparently) is that since m is smaller than every n,
we have that m ^ 3 is smaller than `n0 * n1 * n2`, and so that 'c' is
precisely equal to m ^ 3, rather than congruent to it.

So, following the CRT construction:

    > let msg = "attack at 10pm"
    >
    > Keypair _ p0@(Key e0 n0) <- keygen 1024
    > Keypair _ p1@(Key e1 n1) <- keygen 1024
    > Keypair _ p2@(Key e2 n2) <- keygen 1024
    >
    > let c0 = encrypt p0 msg
    > let c1 = encrypt p1 msg
    > let c2 = encrypt p2 msg
    >
    > let ms0 = n1 * n2
    > let ms1 = n0 * n2
    > let ms2 = n0 * n1
    >
    > :{
