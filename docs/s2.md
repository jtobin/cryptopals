### Set 2

PKCS #7 padding (see section 10.3 of [RFC-2315][pkcs]) just means that
to pad a message of length 'l' to 'k' bytes, one appends `k - (l mod k)`
bytes -- each of value `k - (l mod k)` -- to the message. So here we get
four bytes' worth of padding, each of value 04:

    $ pkcs7 20 "YELLOW SUBMARINE" | xxd
    00000000: 5945 4c4c 4f57 2053 5542 4d41 5249 4e45  YELLOW SUBMARINE
    00000010: 0404 0404                                ....

(Of note, the case for `l mod k = 0` is interesting, since even though
we don't necessarily *need* padding in such a case, we get k bytes
of padding, each with value k, anyway. If one asks for padding, he's
getting padding.)

#### 2.10

Here we're implementing CBC mode for AES. The essential difference
compared to ECB is that CBC (i.e., cipher block chaining) operates
sequentially; ciphertext is produced by folding over the initialization
vector + plaintext in 16-byte blocks, each time XOR-ing the current
block with the previous one before encrypting the result with AES-128 in
ECB mode.

Again, I think it's worth using the openssl tool to gain familiarity
with it:

    $ key=$(echo -n "YELLOW SUBMARINE" | xxd -p)
    $ openssl enc -aes-128-cbc \
        -a -d -K "$key" -nosalt -iv 0 \
        -in data/s2/q10_input.txt | head -2
    I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell
    A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell

The `aes` binary will also get the job done:

    $ key=$(echo -n "YELLOW SUBMARINE" | xxd -p)
    $ ciphertext=$(cat data/s2/q10_input.txt | \
        base64 -d | xxd -p | tr -d '\n')
    $ iv=$(printf '0%.0s' {1..32})
    $ aes decrypt cbc --iv "$iv" "$key" "$ciphertext" | xxd -r -p | head -2
    I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell
    A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell

#### 2.11

Here we want to build what I've dubbed a `chaosEncrypter` and then something
to detect what it might be using on any given iteration.  Easy enough:

    -- in Cryptopals.Block.Attacks

    chaosEncrypter
      :: PrimMonad m
      => BS.ByteString
      -> MWC.Gen (PrimState m)
      -> m BS.ByteString
    chaosEncrypter plaintext gen = do
      key  <- bytes 16 gen
      pre  <- MWC.uniformR (5, 10) gen >>= flip bytes gen
      pos  <- MWC.uniformR (5, 10) gen >>= flip bytes gen

      let tex = pre <> plaintext <> pos
          pad = roundUpToMul 16 (BS.length tex)
          bs = CU.pkcs7 pad tex

      ecb  <- MWC.uniform gen

      if   ecb
      then pure $ AES.encryptEcbAES128 key bs
      else do
        iv <- bytes 16 gen
        pure $ AES.encryptCbcAES128 iv key bs

Note the use of PKCS#7 padding in order to make sure the input length is
always valid. The detection oracle can be produced by simply fmapping
`Cryptopals.Block.Tools.detectMode` over this.

Checking it in action, with some tracing to determine it's working
properly:

    > fmap detectMode $ chaosEncrypter "yellow submarineyellow
      submarineyellow submarineyellow submarine" gen
    was really CBC
    CBC

    > fmap detectMode $ chaosEncrypter "yellow submarineyellow
      submarineyellow submarineyellow submarine" gen
    was really ECB
    ECB

#### 2.12

Here we're breaking AES in ECB mode via byte-at-a-time decryption. The
idea is that, given an AES encryption oracle, we can incrementally
add or subtract bytes from our input to 1) identify that the oracle
is using ECB mode, 2) figure out the block size of the cipher, and 3)
incrementally decrypt the ciphertext it produces.

The block size in AES-128 is 16 bytes, and this becomes apparent when
encrypting at least 17 repeated bytes (as the initial 16-byte ciphertext
block will be unchanged).  Here `alienEncrypter` is the oracle:

    > B16.encodeBase16 $ alienEncrypter (BS.replicate 32 65)
    57eef2e16c3867b9889350eb5732c183
    57eef2e16c3867b9889350eb5732c183
    99203986e6420a8cfed14ef4052331cd
    912d36f3419517ff9092e2f53d814a7b
    41d4bfa372eca117569d2ccbbf34e848
    [..]

The mode detector correctly guesses this to be running in ECB mode when
using 32 bytes of repeated input or more, since that gives us enough
bytes to get repeated blocks in the ciphertext:

    > detectMode $ alienEncrypter (BS.replicate 32 65)
    ECB

The `Cryptopals.Block.Attacks.incrByteEcbAttack` function attacks the provided
oracle by incrementally decrypting bytes:

    > TIO.putStrLn $ TE.decodeUtf8 $ incrByteEcbAttack alienEncrypter
    Rollin' in my 5.0
    With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
    The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
    Did you stop? No, I just drove by

#### 2.13

(N.b., I thought this was super fun.)

The idea here is to craft a ciphertext block that can be swapped into
the opportune position. We want to align everything so that the final
block will start right after the `role=` string, and then craft it as
the enciphered `admin` plus padding.

A 13-byte long email address will be sufficient to push everything to
the desired block boundaries.  I used the following:

    > B16.encodeBase16 $ cpeEncrypt "me@retorts.io"

which produces the following hex-encoded ciphertext (aligned in blocks):

    c4352ebf0bbf88ab50941d47fe7b9e90
    38fa40090568d9af9fa626a8a55409fd
    921defeffad5601a06500289684b16ca   <- 'user' block

Now, inserting some malicious plaintext:

    > let admin = "admin" <> BS.replicate 11 11
    > B16.encodeBase16 $ cpeEncrypt ("me@retorts" <> admin <> ".io")

and that produces the following hex-encoded ciphertext:

    c4352ebf0bbf88ab50941d47fe7b9e90
    d5adeeedb90f079930a3d9c4492746e5   <- evil block
    38fa40090568d9af9fa626a8a55409fd
    921defeffad5601a06500289684b16ca   <- 'user' block

Now all we want to do is replace the final block in the initial
ciphertext, corresponding to `user` and padding, with our malicious
enciphered block:

    c4352ebf0bbf88ab50941d47fe7b9e90
    38fa40090568d9af9fa626a8a55409fd
    d5adeeedb90f079930a3d9c4492746e5   <- evil block

Now we decrypt it (called `evil` below), mua ha ha:

    > let Right ciph = B16.decodeBase16 $ TE.encodeUtf8 evil
    > cpeDecrypt ciph
    "email=me@retorts.io&uid=10&role=admin\v\v\v\v\v\v\v\v\v\v\v"

It's even nicer when one strips the padding as per challenge 15:

    > CU.unpkcs7 $ cpeDecrypt ciph
    Just "email=me@retorts.io&uid=10&role=admin"

#### 2.14

The idea is to inject a block whose ciphertext is known, followed by the
malicious alignment block(s) necessary to perform the attack. One can
figure out ciphertext corresponding to any block of repeated bytes by
just feeding in more than a block's worth of them -- necessarily some
(plaintext) block will then include only that repeated byte.

E.g.: one can determine that "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA" encrypts to
"57eef2e16c3867b9889350eb5732c183", so we can look for that ciphertext
in the result in order to locate an "origin," only analyzing ciphertexts
in which it appears (since, if it doesn't happen to align perfectly in
a block, we won't see it in the ciphertext). By chopping that and any
preceeding bytes from the ciphertext, the attack reduces to the simpler
version we've already performed.

The `Cryptopals.Block.Attacks.hardIncrByteEcbAttack` function will
perform the attack; it's just a version of `incrByteEcbAttack`
from challenge 12 adapted to handle a monadic oracle.
`Cryptopals.Block.Attacks.attackProxy` wraps the `weirdEncrypter` oracle
and does the work of inserting/locating our malicious block and pruning
the ciphertext for us, so we can attack `weirdEncrypter` via:

    > plain <- hardIncrByteEcbAttack (attackProxy weirdEncrypter) gen
    > TIO.putStrLn $ TE.decodeUtf8 plain
    Rollin' in my 5.0
    With my rag-top down so my hair can blow
    The girlies on standby waving just to say hi
    Did you stop? No, I just drove by

#### 2.15

To validate PKCS#7 padding, just look at the last byte of the input,
take that many bytes from the end, and check that they're all the same.
`Cryptopals.Util.unpkcs7` will do it (and strip the padding), returning
Nothing on inputs with invalid padding:

    > CU.unpkcs7 ("ICE ICE BABY\x04\x04\x04\x04" :: BS.ByteString)
    Just "ICE ICE BABY"
    > CU.unpkcs7 ("ICE ICE BABY\x05\x05\x05\x05" :: BS.ByteString)
    Nothing
    > CU.unpkcs7 ("ICE ICE BABY\x01\x02\x03\x04" :: BS.ByteString)
    Nothing

#### 2.16

This one is pretty cool and tricky. AES encryption in CBC (cipher block
chaining) mode proceeds as follows:

    for plaintext                     p     = (p_1, .., p_l)
        block encryption w/key k      enc_k
        initialization vector         IV
        xor operator                  +

    let c_0 = IV
        c_1 = enc_k(c_0 + m_1)
        c_2 = enc_k(c_1 + m_2)
        ..
        c_l = enc_k(c_{l-1} + m_l)

    in  ciphertext                    c = (c_0, c_1, c_2, .., c_l)

and decryption goes like this:

    for ciphertext                    c = (c_0, c_1, c_2, .., c_l)
        block decryption w/key k      dec_k
        xor operator                  +

    let p_1 = dec_k(c_1) + c_0
        p_2 = dec_k(c_2) + c_1
        ..
        p_l = dec_k(c_1) + c_{l-1}

    in  plaintext                     p = (p_1, p_2, .., p_l)

Let plaintext block 3 be "AAAAA!admin!true". Since:

    p_2 = dec_k(c_2) + c_1

if ciphertext block 2 is ".....X.....X...." for unspecified bytes ".",
then we can recover the plaintext "AAAAA;admin=true" by substituting in
the following ciphertext block instead:

    .....X+a.....X+b....

for '+' the XOR operator, 'a' the byte such that '!' + 'a' = ';', and 'b'
the byte such that '!' + 'b' = '='. The second plaintext block, which is found
by passing `c_2` through AES decryption, will be effectively destroyed, but
the third plaintext block will be modified as desired.

(Note by padding the malicious input block with 'A' bytes we line everything
up so as to take advantage of the following semicolon.)

Using an IV of all zero bytes, `Cryptopals.Block.Attacks.bfcEncrypter` will
return the following, given the malicious input:

    00000000000000000000000000000000 ................

    214abfcb615d8c63406ee84093538051 fbacon__________

We can see that 0x3c and 0x37 in ciphertext block 2 (i.e. the third, counting
the IV) need to be changed.  Some calculation shows what we need to XOR them
by:

    > showHex (ord '!' `B.xor` ord ';') mempty
    "1a"

and

    > showHex (ord '!' `B.xor` ord '=') mempty
    "`c"

so we replace 0x3c in `c_2` with `0x3c + 0x1a` and 0x37
with `0x37 + 0x1c` and pass the resulting munged ciphertext
through the ";admin=true;" substring checker found in
`Cryptopals.Block.Attacks.bfcChecker`:

    > bfcChecker munged
    True
