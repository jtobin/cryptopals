### Set 3

#### 3.17

This one took me some fiddling to get right. As stated in the challenge
text itself, it's easy to get hung up on the idea of decrypting padding
bytes themselves. But the idea is to choose ciphertext byte values so as
to *force* valid padding in a "phantom" plaintext, then using the added
information to recover the actual plaintext bytes (padding bytes or no).

From the 2.16 answer text, CBC-mode decryption proceeds as follows:

    for ciphertext                    c = (c_0, c_1, c_2, .., c_l)
        block decryption w/key k      dec_k
        xor operator                  +

    let p_1 = dec_k(c_1) + c_0
        p_2 = dec_k(c_2) + c_1
        ..
        p_l = dec_k(c_l) + c_{l-1}

    in  plaintext                     p = (p_1, p_2, .., p_l)

So, the last plaintext byte can be described by:

    lb(p_l) = lb(dec_k(c_1) + c_{l-1})      (1)

Say one corrupts `c_{l-1}` (producing `c_{l-1}'`) by perturbing the last
byte, and then submits `(c_{l-1}', c_l)` to the padding oracle. The
padding oracle will internally compute:

    p_l' = dec_k(c_l) + c_{l-1}'

and then check its padding. We want to *force* the last byte of `p_l'`
to be 0x01, so we require that 1) the padding of `p_l'` validates, and
2) that this forced padding is not 0x0202 or 0x030303 or some other
scheme. We do this repeatedly until the padding validates as desired
(if we are unlucky and have forced some other padding, e.g. 0x0202, we
just treat that as a failure) yielding:

    lb(dec_k(c_l) + c_{l-1}')     = 0x01
    lb(dec_k(c_l)) + lb(c_{l-1}') = 0x01

so that:

    lb(dec_k(c_l)) = lb(c_{l-1}') + 0x01

and thus (using (1)), that:

    lb(p_l) = lb(dec_k(c_l)) + lb(c_{l-1)}
            = lb(c_{l-1}') + 0x01 + lb(c_{l}).

The same is then true for every other byte. For the penultimate byte,
for example, we want to *force* the penultimate byte of `p_l'` to be
0x02, so we also require that the last byte of `p_l'` be 0x02 in order
for its padding validate. Each time we simply do this by manipulating
`c_{l-1}` appropriately.

`Cryptopals.Block.Attacks.paddingOracle` is a padding oracle, and the
`Cryptopals.Block.Attacks.paddingOracleAttack` function implements the
padding oracle attack (for arbitrary ciphertexts):

    > :{
    ghci| F.for_ [1..10] $ \_ -> putStrLn . show . M.fromJust =<<
    ghci|   fmap (CU.unpkcs7 . paddingOracleAttack) (paddingOracle gen)
    ghci| :}
    "000002Quick to the point, to the point, no faking"
    "000001With the bass kicked in and the Vega's are pumpin'"
    "000000Now that the party is jumping"
    "000000Now that the party is jumping"
    "000004Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble"
    "000005I go crazy when I hear a cymbal"

    "000002Quick to the point, to the point, no faking"
