### Set 3

#### 3.17

This one took me some fiddling to get right. As stated in the challenge
text itself, it's easy to get hung up on the idea of decrypting padding
bytes themselves. But the idea is to choose ciphertext byte values so as
to *force* valid padding in a "phantom" plaintext, then use the added
information to recover the actual plaintext bytes (padding bytes or no).

From the 2.16 answer text, CBC-mode decryption proceeds as follows:

    for ciphertext                    c = (c_0, c_1, c_2, .., c_l)
        block decryption w/key k      dec_k
        xor operator                  +

    let p_1 = dec_k(c_1) + c_0
        p_2 = dec_k(c_2) + c_1
        ..
        p_l = dec_k(c_l) + c_{l-1}

    in  plaintext                     p = (p_1, p_2, .., p_l)

So, the last plaintext byte can be described by:

    lb(p_l) = lb(dec_k(c_1) + c_{l-1})      (1)

Say one corrupts `c_{l-1}` (producing `c_{l-1}'`) by perturbing the last
byte, and then submits `(c_{l-1}', c_l)` to the padding oracle. The
padding oracle will internally compute:

    p_l' = dec_k(c_l) + c_{l-1}'

and then check its padding. We want to *force* the last byte of `p_l'`
to be 0x01, so we require that 1) the padding of `p_l'` validates, and
2) that this forced padding is not 0x0202 or 0x030303 or some other
scheme. We do this repeatedly until the padding validates as desired
(if we are unlucky and have forced some other padding, e.g. 0x0202, we
just treat that as a failure) yielding:

    lb(dec_k(c_l) + c_{l-1}')     = 0x01
    lb(dec_k(c_l)) + lb(c_{l-1}') = 0x01

so that:

    lb(dec_k(c_l)) = lb(c_{l-1}') + 0x01

and thus (using (1)), that:

    lb(p_l) = lb(dec_k(c_l)) + lb(c_{l-1)}
            = lb(c_{l-1}') + 0x01 + lb(c_{l}).

The same is then true for every other byte. For the penultimate byte,
for example, we want to *force* the penultimate byte of `p_l'` to be
0x02, so we also require that the last byte of `p_l'` be 0x02 in order
for its padding to validate. Each time we simply do this by manipulating
`c_{l-1}` appropriately.

`Cryptopals.Block.Attacks.paddingOracle` is a padding oracle, and the
`Cryptopals.Block.Attacks.paddingOracleAttack` function implements the
padding oracle attack (for arbitrary ciphertexts):

    > :{
    ghci| F.for_ [1..10] $ \_ -> putStrLn . show . M.fromJust =<<
    ghci|   fmap (CU.unpkcs7 . paddingOracleAttack) (paddingOracle gen)
    ghci| :}
    "000002Quick to the point, to the point, no faking"
    "000001With the bass kicked in and the Vega's are pumpin'"
    "000000Now that the party is jumping"
    "000000Now that the party is jumping"
    "000004Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble"
    "000005I go crazy when I hear a cymbal"
    "000003Cooking MC's like a pound of bacon"
    "000002Quick to the point, to the point, no faking"
    "000003Cooking MC's like a pound of bacon"
    "000004Burning 'em, if you ain't quick and nimble"

#### 3.18

(FIXME, add binaries for these.)

CTR mode is trivial; the only thing to get right is really the specified
counter format. `Cryptopals.AES.decryptCtrAES128` (or its synonym,
`encryptCtrAES128`) can be used to retrieve our desired plaintext:

    > let Right cip = B64.decodeBase64 "L77na/nrFsKvynd6HzOoG7GHTLXsTVu9qvY/2syLXzhPweyyMTJULu/6/kXX0KSvoOLSFQ=="
    > decryptCtrAES128 0 "YELLOW SUBMARINE" cip
    "Yo, VIP Let's kick it Ice, Ice, baby Ice, Ice, baby "

#### 3.19 (and 3.20)

I used the same approach as was done in question 1.6, taking the
first 16 bytes of each ciphertext and then transposing them such that
each "block" has been single-byte XOR'd by something. Using a similar
scoring routine (see `Cryptopals.Block.Attacks.rnBest`) and some manual
fiddling, one can recover the keystream without much difficulty. Finding
the first 16 bytes exposes enough of the plaintexts that the remaining
bytes can be completed by hand, though I bailed out after I got the
gist of it:

    > let ks = BS.pack $ fmap (\(a, _, _) -> a) . rnBest) rnrotated
    > -- the resulting keystream needed some manual patching, but
    > -- results like "eighteeoth-centu" make it easy to do.
    > take 4 $ fmap (CU.fixedXor ks) rnscrypted
    ["I have met them ","Coming with vivi","From counter or ","Eighteenth-centu"]

(It turns out this is the way one is supposed to solve 3.20 too.  Whoops!)

#### 3.21

The only annoying thing about this problem is finding a test vector to
check the implementation on. `Cryptopals.Stream.RNG.MT19937` implements
the Mersenne Twister (MT19937) PRNG in standard return-the-generator
fashion:

    > let gen = seed 42
    > :{
    ghci| let loop g = let (x, g1) = extract g
    ghci|                  (y, g2) = extract g1
    ghci|                  (z, g3) = extract g2
    ghci|              in  ([x,y,z], g3)
    ghci| :}
    > fst $ loop gen
    [1880174161,2921269485,2329092166]
